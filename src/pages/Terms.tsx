                  <p>
                    Web cookies are small computer files that a website places on an Internet user's computer to store basic information. 
                    Generally, cookies help website operators serve their users better and more quickly. There are two types of cookies: 
                    session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an Internet user's online session. They do not collect 
                    information from a user's computer, and they typically store information only in the form of session identification. 
                    Session cookies are erased from a user's computer when the user closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain 
                    on a user's computer after the browser has been closed and are stored on a user's hard drive until they expire or until 
                    the user deletes the cookie. Persistent cookies are used to collect identifying information about a user, such as Web 
                    surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific website.

                  <p>
                    When you interact with the Delta Life Insurance Company website, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. 
                    Our Web server uses both session and persistent cookies to improve your interaction with the Website, and to help us 
                    improve user experience. We use cookies to measure behavior on this website for usability purposes and to save choices 
                    made on some pages. The cookies used on this website do not identify you personally. Unless you choose to identify yourself 
                    voluntarily, they merely recognize your browser. You may choose to identify yourself to us by requesting a quote, by 
                    requesting more information on a product or service, or by completing one of several contact forms. Otherwise, you remain 
                    anonymous. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies can still browse this website. However, we 
                    encourage you to accept cookies (which can be set through your browser settings) so that we may take further strides in 
                    making this website easier to use.
